Description: Dependency On Server At Boot
 This script reads a list of servers from the config file server.list and
 determines whether they are contactable. If they are, commands stored in the
 file server-name.available will be executed, if they are not, commands stored
 in the file server-name.unavailable will be executed. The existence of these
 files is not obligatory. Whilst this script could be run at any time, it is
 probably most useful at boot and installs a systemd service file to this
 effect.
